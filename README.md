# Chessboard Analysis using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project analyzes chessboard images to count the number of black and white squares, using computer vision techniques in Python. The solution handles variations in lighting, orientation, and distortion to accurately detect and classify chessboard squares.

## Objectives
- Implement an algorithm to detect and count black and white squares in a chessboard image.
- Handle variations in orientation, lighting, shadows, and distortion.
- Provide results including annotated images and counts of black and white squares.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
